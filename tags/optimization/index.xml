In this post, I will deep dive into the methods for automatic differentiation (AD). After reading this post, I hope you can feel confident with using the various AD techniques, and hopefully never manually calculate derivatives again. Note that this post is not a comparison between AD libraries. For that, a good starting point is here.
Why Automatic Differentiation? Automatic differentiation is a natural continuation of scientists and engineersâ€™ pursuit for mechanizing computation.</description></item></channel></rss>
