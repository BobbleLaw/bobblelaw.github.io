Warning: You are using gcc version '7.x.x'. The version of gcc is not supported. The version currently supported with MEX is '6.4.x'. For a list of currently supported compilers see An easy solution is to do as followed (simply install the target version),
sudo apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ sudo apt-get install build-essential software-properties-common -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ sudo apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ sudo apt-get install gcc-6 g++-6 -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-6 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-6 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ gcc -v But this will affect the global gcc/g++, so we change the configure file for mex only,</description></item></channel></rss>
