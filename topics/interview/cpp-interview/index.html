It allows for the exchange of data between devices, such as microcontrollers, sensors, and computers, using a simple two-wire interface: one for transmitting data (TX) and one for receiving data (RX).</p><h4 id=key-features-of-uart>Key Features of UART:</h4><p><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> UART does not require a clock signal to synchronize the transmitter and receiver. Instead, it uses start and stop bits to frame the data, which allows for flexible timing.</p><p><strong>Data Framing:</strong> Each data packet typically consists of:</p><ul><li>1 Start Bit: Indicates the beginning of a transmission.</li><li>Data Bits: Usually 5 to 9 bits of actual data.</li><li>Optional Parity Bit: Used for error checking (even, odd, or none).</li><li>1 or 2 Stop Bits: Indicate the end of the transmission.</li></ul><p><strong>Baud Rate:</strong> The speed of communication is defined by the baud rate, which indicates how many bits per second are transmitted. Both the transmitter and receiver must be set to the same baud rate for successful communication.</p><p><strong>Full Duplex:</strong> UART can send and receive data simultaneously, allowing for full-duplex communication.</p><p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The UART protocol is simple to implement in hardware and software, making it a popular choice for many embedded applications.</p><h4 id=applications-of-uart>Applications of UART:</h4><p><strong>Microcontroller Communication:</strong> UART is often used to interface microcontrollers with peripherals like GPS modules, Bluetooth devices, and GSM modules.</p><p><strong>Debugging:</strong> Developers frequently use UART for debugging purposes, allowing them to send log messages from an embedded system to a terminal on a computer.</p><p><strong>Data Transfer:</strong> It is commonly used for low-speed data transfer between devices.</p><h4 id=example-of-uart-communication>Example of UART Communication:</h4><p>In a typical scenario, a microcontroller might send a command to a GPS module using UART. The microcontroller configures the UART settings (baud rate, data bits, etc.), sends a command string, and waits for a response, which the GPS module sends back over the same UART interface.</p><p>Overall, UART is a foundational technology in embedded systems, providing a reliable way to facilitate communication between various components.</p><h3 id=i2c-inter-integrated-circuit>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)</h3><h4 id=working-of-i2c-communication-protocol>Working of I2C Communication Protocol</h4><p>It uses only 2 bi-directional open-drain lines for data communication called SDA and SCL. Both these lines are pulled high.</p><ul><li><strong>Serial Data (SDA):</strong> Transfer of data takes place through this pin.</li><li><strong>Serial Clock (SCL) :</strong> It carries the clock signal.</li></ul><p>I2C operates in 2 modes</p><ul><li>Master mode</li><li>Slave mode</li></ul><p>Each data bit transferred on SDA line is synchronized by a high to the low pulse of each clock on the SCL line.</p><p>According to I2C protocols, the data line can not change when the clock line is high, it can change only when the clock line is low. The 2 lines are open drain, hence a pull-up resistor is required so that the lines are high since the devices on the I2C bus are active low. The data is transmitted in the form of packets which comprises 9 bits. The sequence of these bits are</p><ol><li>Start Condition: 1 bit</li><li>Slave Address: 8 bit</li><li>Acknowledge: 1 bit</li></ol><h4 id=steps-of-i2c-data-transmission>Steps of I2C Data Transmission</h4><p>Here are the steps of I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) data transmission</p><ol><li><strong>Start Condition:</strong> The master device sends a start condition by pulling the SDA line low while the SCL line is high. This signals that a transmission is about to begin.</li><li><strong>Addressing the Slave:</strong> The master sends the 7-bit address of the slave device it wants to communicate with, followed by a read/write bit. The read/write bit indicates whether it wants to read from or write to the slave.</li><li><strong>Acknowledge Bit (ACK):</strong> The addressed slave device responds by pulling the SDA line low during the next clock pulse (SCL). This confirms that the slave is ready to communicate.</li><li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> The master or slave (depending on the read/write operation) sends data in 8-bit chunks. After each byte, an ACK is sent to confirm that the data has been received successfully.</li><li><strong>Stop Condition:</strong> When the transmission is complete, the master sends a stop condition by releasing the SDA line to high while the SCL line is high. This signals that the communication session has ended.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Q: Explain the physical layer of the I2C protocol</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p>I2C is pure master and slave communication protocol, it can be the multi-master or multi-slave but we generally see a single master in I2C communication. In I2C only two-wire are used for communication, one is data bus (SDA) and the second one is the clock bus (CLK).</p><p>All slave and master are connected with same data and clock bus, here important thing is to remember these buses are connected to each other using the WIRE-AND configuration which is done by to putting both pins is open drain. The wire-AND configuration allows in I2C to connect multiple nodes to the bus without any short circuits from signal contention.</p><p>The open-drain allows the master and slave to drive the line low and release to high impedance state. So In that situation, when master and slave release the bus, need a pull resistor to pull the line high. The value of the pull-up resistor is very important as per the perspective of the design of the I2C system because the incorrect value of the pull-up resistor can lead to signal loss.</p><p>Note: We know that I2c communication protocol supports multiple masters and multiple slaves, but most system designs include only one master.</p><p><em><strong>Question: Explain the operation and frame of I2C protocol</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p>I2C is a chip to chip communication protocol. In I2C, communication is always started by the master. When the master wants to communicate with slave then he asserts a start bit followed by the slave address with read/write bit.</p><p>After asserting the start bit, all slave comes in the attentive mode. If the transmitted address match with any of the slave on the bus then an ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (ACK) bit is sent by the slave to the master.</p><p>After getting the ACK bit, master starts the communication. If there is no slave whose address match with the transmitted address then master received a NOT-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (NACK) bit, in that situation either master assert the stop bit to stop the communication or assert a repeated start bit on the line for new communication.</p><p>When we send or receive the bytes in i2c, we always get a NACK bit or ACK bit after each byte of the data is transferred during the communication.</p><p>In I2C, one bit is always transmitted on every clock. A byte which is transmitted in I2C could be an address of the device, the address of register or data which is written to or read from the slave.</p><p>In I2C, SDA line is always stable during the high clock phase except for the start condition, stop condition and repeated start condition. The SDA line only changes their state during the low clock phase.</p><p>See the below image,<br><img src=../images/i2c-frame.jpg alt="I2C frame"></p><p><em><strong>Question: What is START bit and STOP bit?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p><strong>Start Condition</strong>:<br>The default state of SDA and SCL line is high. A master asserts the start condition on the line to start the communication. A high to low transition of the SDA line while the SCL line is high called the START condition. The START condition is always asserted by the master. The I2C bus is considered busy after the assertion of the START bit.</p><p><img src=../images/i2start.jpg alt="i2c start bit"></p><p><strong>Stop Condition</strong>:<br>The STOP condition is asserted by the master to stop the communication. A Low to high transition of SDA line while the SCL line is high called the STOP condition. The STOP condition is always asserted by the master. The I2C bus is considered free after the assertion of the STOP bit.</p><p><img src=../images/stop-min.jpg alt="I2c stop"></p><p><em>Note: A START and STOP condition always asserted by the master.</em></p><p><em><strong>Question: What is the repeated start condition?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p>The repeated start condition similar to the START condition but both are different from each other. The repeated start is asserted by the master before the stop condition (When the bus is not in an idle state).</p><p>A Repeated Start condition is asserted by the master when he does not want to lose their control from the bus. The repeated start is beneficial for the master when it wants to start a new communication without asserting the stop condition.</p><p><em>Note: Repeated start is beneficial when more than one master connected with the I2c Bus.</em></p><p><em><strong>Question: What is the standard bus speed in I2C?</strong></em><br>There are following speed mode in I2C:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Mode</th><th>Speed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Standard-mode</td><td>100 kbit/s</td></tr><tr><td>Fast-mode</td><td>400 kbit/s</td></tr><tr><td>Fast-mode Plus</td><td>1 Mbit/s</td></tr><tr><td>High-speed mode</td><td>3.4 Mbit/s</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Question: What is the limiting factor as to how many devices can go on the I²C bus?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p>It depends on the total capacitance.</p><p><em><strong>Question: Who sends the start bit?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p>In I2C master sends the start bit.</p><p><em><strong>Question: What is the maximum bus length of the I2C bus?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p>It depends on the bus-load (capacitance) and the speed. Basically I2C is not designed for long-distance. It is limited to a few meters. For fast mode, and resistor pullup, capacitance should be less than 200pF, according to “UM10204.pdf” NXP document. So If your wire is 20pF/25cm and you have another 80pF of stray and input capacitance, you’re limited to 1.5m of cable length. But it is only a rough assumption. It can vary in real scenarios.</p><p><em><strong>Question: What is a bus arbitration?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p>The arbitration is required in the case of a multi-master, where more than one master is tried to communicate with a slave simultaneously. In I2C arbitration is achieved by the SDA line.</p><p>For Example,<br>Suppose two masters in the I2C bus is tried to communicate with a slave simultaneously then they will assert a start condition on the bus. The SCL clock of the I2c bus would be already synchronized by the wired and logic.</p><p><img src=../images/arbitration-min.jpg alt="Bus Arbitration"></p><p>In the above case, everything will be good till the state of SDA line will same what is the masters driving on the bus. If any master sees that the state of SDA line differs, what is it driving then they will exit from the communication and lose their arbitration.</p><p><em>Note: Master which is losing their arbitration will wait till the bus become free.</em></p><p><em><strong>Question: What is I2C clock stretching?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p>In I2c, communication can be paused by the clock stretching to holding the SCL line low and it cannot continue until the SCL line released high again.</p><p><img src=../images/i2c-clock-stretch.jpg alt="Clock Stretching"></p><p>In I2C, slave able to receive a byte of data on the fast rate but sometimes slave takes more time in processing the received bytes in that situation slave pull the SCL line to pause the transaction and after the processing of the received bytes, it again released the SCL line high again to resume the communication.</p><p>The clock stretching is the way in which slave drive the SCL line but it is the fact, most of the slave does not drive the SCL line</p><p>Note: In the I2C communication protocol, most of the I2C slave devices do not use the clock stretching feature, but every master should support the clock stretching.</p><p><em><strong>Question: What is I2C clock synchronization?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em></p><p>Unlike RS-232, I2C is synchronous communication, in which the clock is always generated by the master and this clock is shared by both master and slave. In the case of multi-master, all master generate their own SCL clock, hence it is necessary that the clock of all master should be synchronized. In the i2C, this clock synchronization is done by wired and logic.</p><p>For a better understanding, I am taking an example, where two masters try to communicate with a slave. In that situation, both masters generate their own clock, master M1 generate clk1 and master M2 generate clk2 and clock which observed on the bus is SCL.</p><p><img src=../images/Clock-sync.jpg alt="Clock Sync"></p><p>The SCL clock would be the Anding (clk1 & clk2) of clk1 and clk2 and most interesting thing is that highest logic 1 of SCL line defines by the CLK which has lowest logic 1.</p><h4 id=more-i2c-questions>More I2C questions</h4><ol><li>Can devices be added and removed while the system is running (Hot swapping) in I2C?</li><li>What is the standard bus speed in I2C?</li><li>How many devices can be connected in a standard I2C communication?</li><li>What are the 2 roles of nodes in I2C communication?</li><li>What are the modes of operation in I2C communication?</li><li>What is bus arbitration?</li><li>Advantages and limitations of I2C communication?</li><li>How many wires are required for I2C communication?

The master device controls the communication, and one or more slave devices get connected to it. The SPI protocol typically involves the following four key signals:</p><ul><li><strong>MOSI (Master Output Slave Input):</strong> Data line through which the master sends data to the slave.</li><li><strong>MISO (Master Input Slave Output):</strong> Data line in which the slave sends data back to the master.</li><li><strong>SCK (Serial Clock):</strong> This clock signal synchronizes the data transfer between the master and the slave.</li><li><strong>SS/CS (Slave Select/Chip Select):</strong> The signal from the master to select the active slave device.</li></ul><h4 id=multiple-slave-configuration-options>Multiple Slave Configuration Options</h4><ul><li><strong>Independent Slave Select Lines:</strong> Each slave device can have its own SS line for individual selection.<ul><li>Advantages<ul><li>Simple and Direct: Each slave device is independently addressed via its SS line. It allows easy communication with individual devices without worrying about collisions or sharing data paths.</li><li>Flexible: Each device can operate at different SPI clock speeds, modes (CPOL/CPHA), and configurations.</li><li>No Need for Special Firmware: The SPI controller can select the slave by toggling the SS line, and there&rsquo;s no need for the slaves to be aware of each other.</li></ul></li><li>Disadvantages<ul><li>More Pins Required: A trade-off is the need for more GPIO pins on the master.

Hence, it is scalable for large systems with many devices.</li><li>Reduces Wiring Complexity: With fewer lines needed, the physical complexity of the system is reduced, making it easier to route and manage.</li><li>Simplifies Large-Scale Systems: For IoT devices with many peripherals, a daisy-chaining approach helps keep the system clean and simple, with fewer constraints on pin resources.</li></ul></li><li>Disadvantages:<ul><li>Potential for Increased Latency: Each slave in the chain must receive and forward data, which introduces latency. If you have many slaves, the total data transfer time will increase because each slave must process and pass the data sequentially.</li><li>Fixed Communication Speed: All slaves must communicate at the same SPI speed and clock mode.

</code></pre><ol><li>BIOS</li></ol><p>The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) initializes the hardware, including the screen and keyboard, and tests the main memory. This process is also called POST (Power On Self Test).</p><p>The BIOS software is stored on a ROM chip on the motherboard. After this, the remainder of the boot process is completely controlled by the operating system.</p><ol start=2><li>Master Boot Records (MBR) and Boot Loader</li></ol><p>Once the POST is completed, the system control passes from the BIOS to the boot loader. The boot loader is usually stored on one of the hard disks in the system, either in the boot sector (for traditional BIOS/MBR systems). Up to this stage, the machine does not access any mass storage media. Thereafter, information on the date, time, and the most important peripherals are loaded from the CMOS values (after a technology used for the battery-powered memory store - which allows the system to keep track of the date and time even when it is powered off).</p><p>A number of boot loaders exist for Linux; the most common ones are GRUB (for GRand Unified Boot loader) and ISOLINUX (for booting from removable media). Most Linux boot loaders can present a user interface for choosing alternative options for booting Linux, and even other operating systems that might be installed. When booting Linux, the boot loader is responsible for loading the kernel image and the initial RAM disk (which contains some critical files and device drivers needed to start the system) into memory.</p><ol start=3><li>Boot Loader in Action</li></ol><p>The boot loader has two distinct stages:</p><p>First Stage:</p><p>For systems using the BIOS/MBR method, the boot loader resides at the first sector of the hard disk also known as the Master Boot Record(MBR). The size of the MBR is just 512 bytes. In this stage, the boot loader examines the partition table and finds a bootable partition. Once it finds a bootable partition, it then searches for the second stage bootloader e.g, GRUB, and loads it into RAM (Random Access Memory).</p><p>Second Stage:</p><p>The second stage boot loader resides under /boot. A splash screen is displayed which allows us to choose which Operating System (OS) to boot. After choosing the OS, the boot loader loads the kernel of the selected operating system into RAM and passes control to it.<br>The boot loader loads the selected kernel image (in the case of Linux) and passes control to it. Kernels are almost always compressed, so it&rsquo;s first job is to uncompress itself. After this, it will check and analyze the system hardware and initialize any hardware device drivers built into the kernel.</p><ol start=4><li>The Linux Kernel</li></ol><p>The boot loader loads both the kernel and an initial RAM–based filesystem (initramfs) into memory so it can be used directly by the kernel.<br>When the kernel is loaded in RAM, it immediately initializes and configures the computer’s memory and also configures all the hardware attached to the system. This includes all processors, I/O subsystems, storage devices, etc. The kernel also loads some necessary user space applications.</p><ol start=5><li>The Initial RAM Disk</li></ol><p>The initramfs filesystem image contains programs and binary files that perform all actions needed to mount the proper root filesystem, like providing kernel functionality for the needed file system and device drivers for mass storage controllers with a facility called udev (for User Device) which is responsible for figuring out which devices are present, locating the drivers they need to operate properly, and loading them. After the root filesystem has been found, it is checked for errors and mounted.</p><p>The mount program instructs the operating system that a file system is ready for use, and associates it with a particular point in the overall hierarchy of the filesystem (the mount point). If this is successful, the initramfs is cleared from RAM and the init program on the root filesystem (/sbin/init) is executed.</p><p>init handles the mounting and pivoting over to the final real root filesystem. If special hardware drivers are needed before the mass storage can be accessed, they must be in the initramfs image.</p><ol start=6><li>/sbin/init and Services</li></ol><p>Once the kernel has set up all its hardware and mounted the root filesystem, the kernel runs the /sbin/init program. This then becomes the initial process, which then starts other processes to get the system running. Most other processes on the system trace their origin ultimately to init; the exceptions are kernel processes, started by the kernel directly for managing internal operating system details.</p><p>Traditionally, this process startup was done using conventions that date back to System V UNIX, with the system passing through a sequence of runlevels containing collections of scripts that start and stop services. Each runlevel supports a different mode of running the system. Within each runlevel, individual services can be set to run, or to be shut down if running. Newer distributions are moving away from the System V standard, but usually support the System V conventions for compatibility purposes.</p><p>Besides starting the system, init is responsible for keeping the system running and for shutting it down cleanly. It acts as the &ldquo;manager of last resort&rdquo; for all non-kernel processes, cleaning up after them when necessary, and restarts user login services as needed when users log in and out.</p><ol start=7><li>Text Mode Login</li></ol><p>Near the end of the boot process, init starts a number of text-mode login prompts (done by a program called getty). These enable you to type your username, followed by your password, and to eventually get a command shell.</p><p>Usually, the default command shell is bash (the GNU Bourne Again Shell), but there are a number of other advanced command shells available. The shell prints a text prompt, indicating it is ready to accept commands; after the user types the command and presses Enter, the command is executed, and another prompt is displayed after the command is done.</p><ol start=8><li>X Window System (Optional)</li></ol><h3 id=data-protection-strategies>Data protection strategies</h3><ol><li><code>volatile</code> keyword</li></ol><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-cpp data-lang=cpp><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>volatile</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>int</span> kX;
