### Game Design vs. Game Development

First of all, we need to talk about the difference between game design and game development.

These two are sometimes interchangeable but distinct.

__Game Designer__ needs to know
+ game concept
+ mechanics
+ storyline

while __Game developer__ tends to know
+ animation
+ engine programming

Here are some websites you defintely should take a look to learn how to become a good game designer.
+ [GameDesigning](http://www.gamedesigning.org) introduces many basic concepts about game design to help you better understand what this position does, and how to prepare for it.
+ [Tencent Institue of Games](https://gameinstitute.qq.com/community), which is in Chinese, holds many insightful articles summarized by Tencent game designers (develpoers as well). Most of the articles are practical both for your game design or interview preparing, because they use Tencent's own games to support their arguments.


写策划案不是写小说，很多时候要求策划用定义式的语句去描述。这也要求策划本身有比较好的概括能力。


初级的游戏策划师能够明白结构化的东西更容易体现概念之间的关系，同时能帮助语句变得简洁。同时注意，这两个“句子”其实都是没有主语和句号的。但这样其实在阅读理解上会变得更加容易，查找也更方便了。
