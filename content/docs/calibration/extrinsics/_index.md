## Problem Statement

The hand-eye calibration problem got its name from the robotics community, where the cameras("eye") work collaboratively with the gripper("hand") of a robot. Based on the difference camera configuration.

## Application

Although hand-eye calibration gets a "hand" in its name, the solutions and conclusions of this problem can be applied to more areas without robotics gripper.
