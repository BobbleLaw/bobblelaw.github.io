## About me

Welcome! My name is Lo TszWan (try to read it in Cantonese), call me Bob for convenience. 
This is my personal blog where I write articles about programming, algorithms, and thoughts on working projects. 
My focus mainly lies on:

- 3D Reconstrction
- Geometry Processing
- Computer Graphics
- C++/Swift Programming

In general, I get a broad range of interests in algorithms and engineering related 3D, as I always believe that 3D techniques are beyond gaming, and immersive AR/VR devices will be the game changer in next gen human-computer interface. 
To some reasons, I have been working in smart manufacturing for years since graduate school. I built a high accuracy structured light scanner for tools inspection, and dug into camera calibration and workpiece localization for better geometry perception. However, the further I go, the more I realize that's not what I like. So I decided to dive into consumer 3D technology again. Luckily, most of the concepts and algorithms I developed in the past experience can be applied to 3D entertainment applications.
I'll gradually organize my previous works and working project, and update them to this website or Github. Stay tune! Hopefully I can accomplish it in half a year.
